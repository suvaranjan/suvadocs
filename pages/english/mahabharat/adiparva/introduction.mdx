Adi Parva describes how the epic came to be recited by **Ugrasrava Sauti** to the assembled rishis at the **Naimisha Forest** after first having been narrated at the **sarpasatra** of **Janamejaya** by **Vaishampayana** at **Taxila**. It includes an outline of contents from the eighteen books, along with the book's significance. The history of the Bhāratas and the Bhrigus are described. The main part of the work covers the birth and early life of the princes of the Kuru Kingdom and the persecution of the Pandavas by Dhritarashtra.

These sections weave together to form the epic's foundation, introducing readers to the genealogies, significant incidents, and divine interventions that set the stage for the dramatic events that follow.
